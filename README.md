# OpenCore Installer

This repo provides an [OpenCore](../../../acidanthera/OpenCorePkg) components and ASCII preference list generator based on Apple's Python `plistlib` library and is not a substitute to OpenCore [documentation](../../../acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/tree/master/Docs). Its purpose is to automate your current OC knowledge through Python and should be considered a learning example.

Acidanthera provides a very comprehensive [manual](../../../acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/blob/master/Docs/Configuration.pdf) for configuring OpenCore. To get the most out of OpenCore, it is important to read the manual and understand its settings. As a learning example, this tool adheres to that philosophy.
